Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be used to develop a wide range of programs and is not focused on any one issue. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages due to its versatility and beginner friendliness. It was the most popular programming language among developers in 2020, according to a survey done by industry analyst firm RedMonk.</p>

The Verification and Validation model is another name for it. Based on a testing phase for each development stage, the V-Model is an extension to the waterfall model, which means a testing phase for every phase of the development cycle. After the previous step is completed, the following phase begins. It is a highly disciplined model. Testing and development phases are planned concurrently in the V-Model. In other words, there are Verification and Validation phases on either side of the V. There are two sides to every V-Model. The application of the V-Model is quite similar to that of the waterfall model, as both models are sequential. Before the commencement of a project, the requirements must be crystal clear, as it can be costly to make changes later on. Medical development uses this strategy because it is a highly disciplined industry. The V-Model technique has the advantage of being simple to learn and apply. This model's simplicity makes it easy to manage. Due to its inflexibility and high cost of updating the model in today's dynamic world, the model's drawback is that modifications are difficult and expensive to make.</p>

Starting with money and effort as inputs results in software that may or may not meet client needs. This Big Bang Model does not follow a process/procedure, and there is very little planning required for this model to be effective and efficient. Even the customer is unsure of what he wants; the requirements are applied on the fly without many studies. This strategy is typically used for short projects with a small development team. This Big Bang Model has the virtue of being extremely simple and requiring little or no forethought. Manageable and without formal procedures. However, changes in needs or misinterpreted requirements might lead to a total reversal or scrapping of the project in the Big Bang Model. Ideal for minor, low-risk, repeated projects.</p>

Methods such as agile divide the product into small increments. Iterations of these builds are made available to users. Typically, each iteration lasts between one and three weeks. In every iteration, cross-functional teams work simultaneously on a variety of areas, including: 1) Analysis of Planning Needs; 2) Unit Testing and Acceptance Testing; 3) Unfinished prototypes are shown to customers as well as those who are involved in its development. According to the Agile model, it should handle every project differently. Existing methodologies should be customized to best suit the project requirements; to deliver specific features for a release. Tasks are separated into time boxes (short time frames) in Agile. The technique is iterative, with each iteration delivering a viable software build. In terms of features, each build is incremental; the final form contains all of the components required by the customer.</p>

While writing the software, you'll need to think about how you will create a product. Focus is on acquiring customer requirements through workshops or focus groups, early prototyping by the customer using an iterative concept, reuse of existing components, continuous integration, and speedy delivery. The RAD model can be successfully applied to projects where unambiguous modularization is possible. RAD may fail if the project cannot be divided into modules. The instances in which RAD can be employed are described in the following:</p>
                                                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">1. When a system can be modularized and deployed incrementally, RAD should be employed.</p>
                                                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">2. It should be employed if there is a high availability of Modeling designers.</p>
                                                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">3. It should only be utilized if the budget allows for the usage of automated code generation technologies.</p>
                                                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">4. The RAD SDLC paradigm should be used only if domain specialists with relevant business knowledge are available.</p>
                                                                  <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">5. Should be utilized when project requirements change and workable prototypes are to be given to the customer in minor iterations of 2-3 months.</p>
                                                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The RAD paradigm provides rapid delivery by reducing overall development time due to component reusability and simultaneous development. RAD works well only when highly skilled engineers are available, and the customer is also committed to completing the targeted prototype within the time limit specified. The model may fail if either side is unwilling to commit.</p>
